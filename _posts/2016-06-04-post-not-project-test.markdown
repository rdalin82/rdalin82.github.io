## Princeton Algorithm's course on Coursera

I just finished my algorithms course on Coursera where I definitely stretched my Java skills and learned a lot about Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Binary Search Trees, Tries, Graphs, and Strings.  We also covered some really cool projects, my favorites being Wordnet, Percolation, and 8Puzzle Solver.  Wordnet was a great project because we got to use graphs and breadth first search to find the shortest ancestor path between two words, which helped in finding which word was the outliers in the set of words.  Percolation was a really cool first project for the class using UnionFind, a concept that I was unfamiliar with but thought it was very interesting in how simply it could be implemented.  8Puzzle Solver was just a lot of fun, we used Priority Queues and A* algorithm to solve slider puzzles of NxN size.  The algorithm would look at the Manhattan distance and how many tiles were out of place using Hamming distance.  Next you would attach the next puzzle that was closest to the goal game state(which was the minimum priority) to the game tree.  

## What I plan to learn next

### Natural Language processing 

On Youtube there is a video series by sentdex that seems really fun on Natural Language processing. The main focus of the series is NLTK (natural language tool kit) and python3.  I haven't really touched much python since my interactive python class so it would be nice to learn some more python.

### More Rails 

I also need to finish up working on my project odin rails forms project Flight Picker. Learning a little more about rails associates in this project has really helped and I'm looking forward to focusing a little more on UI (user interaction) on this project.  Additionally utilizing date pickers, forms, and drop downs.  I'm especially interested in getting a more solid grasp on how DateTime works with ruby and passing dates from the front end to the back end in a clean way.  

### Scheme and SCIP

I'd really like to hit up SCIP before the end of the year.  I think covering some functional language would be really beneficial even with ruby but also with potentially using functional languages in the future. 

### You don't know javascript book series 

I've read the scopes and closures book and I'm just really impressed how far into javascript the author goes and I can't wait to cover more of his books.  

### SQL

Never hurts to learn more SQL as well.
