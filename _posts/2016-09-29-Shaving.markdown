## What do you mean you don't buy your razor blades at the pharmacy? 

As of this month I decided to ditch my Gilette Fusion Razor in favor of a Double Edge/Safety Razor(this type of razor goes by both terms and will be here after referred to as DE).  The DE I ended up going with is a Parker 24C which features an open comb(read: slight more aggressive because the blade has more exposure to your skin).  

However you cannot just simply buy a DE you need a shaving brush to generate lather, also ditch your shaving cream from the can in favor of some shaving soap, as well as ditch your expensive cartridges for price effective double sided razor blades.  

The shaving soap I went with is from Taylor of Old Bond Street with the peppermint scent.  A common recommendation was to go with sandalwood, but since I dislike sandalwood, I decided peppermint was the best choice, I may consider lavendar in the future. Razor blades will be discussed in the next section.  Shaving brush I went with a omega boar brush.  This brush is pretty affordable and gets better over time.  Boar hair tends to split as you use it more creating more ends with makes the brush softer.  So far I am very happy with the boar brush.  Many people consider the badger hair to be superior, I would like to get a badger brush down the road, but I am so happy with my boar brush and currently bathroom sink space is limited I have decided to wait on the badger brush.

### Razors!?!?! 

In preparation to make the plunge into wet shaving I did a lot of reading and watching youtube videos.  I really like to dig into a topic before I try it out myself.  So I spent a lot of time watching youtube videos, reading web forum comments, stalking the subredit /r/wicked_edge (These guys are really cool and helpful).  From my research the most influential variable in shaving is the blade you are using.  It is not simply, some blades are good, so are bad.  It is more of a question is this blade good for you or is it bad for you?  From my month of experience, I find myself measuring blades goodness v badness on 2 factors.  

The first factor being irritation caused by shaving.  For me the irritation isn't really bad and is covered up by using a post shave balm.  I have seen some people online who have posted pictures of part of their face being shaved off because a blade was too sharp, or they didn't know what they were doing/used too much pressure, or some combination of the two.  I usually get very mild irritation because I am very careful. 

The other factor is smoothness/hair removal.  This can be measured by how much stubble is left and how long it takes to grow back.  

I have tried 3 blades so far and would like to document my observations on my own personal experiences.  Since everyone's face is different Your MilGillette Fusion: eage May Vary (YMMY (one of my favorite phrases, because its so true)).  Originally I thought of my face not being very sensitive.  I have a fairly quickly and thickly growing facial hair, which in my opinion cartridge razors don't stand up to.  My initial thought was to go for sharper blades (based on common opinions, again YMMY) since my facial hair is thicker, I highly doubted I had that I had sensitive skin. 

####First Razor: Sharks

First off, someone pointed out that a lot of these packagings have a very old school feel to them.  I would guess 1960s, but I'm not great at guessing decade.  I think the look is cool and you'll see some more of the photos soon and hopefully you enjoy the aesthetic too.  Sharks I think are the sharpest I've tried so far.  My reasoning is they have given me the most irritation, but also the closest shave with the fewest passes.  I suspect they are too sharp for what I am doing.  This was the first blade I tried, and considered possibly it was a technique problem that I was having, but now that I have double backed and tried them.  I am fairly certain these are a little more aggressive than I want.  

####Second Razor: Personna

These have been my favorite so far.  They have yet to cause irritation on my skin, and I am able to get a close shave with them.  The biggest downside of the blades are they take a lot of passes, maybe close to double with other blades, to get a close shave.  With Personna blades I will probably go, with the grain, against the grain, cross the grain and repeat that 2-3 times to get down to a smooth skin.  However I have yet to make too many passes and cause any irritation to the skin.  Part of me thinks there might be a slightly sharper blade that doesn't cause irritation, however 0 irritation with smoothness is a pretty acceptable result. 

####Third Razor: Astra

I'd say these are in the middle.  They're aggressive enough they cause some irritation, however not very much.  They get a close shave without as many passes as the sharks.  If I am going to find the perfect blade, it exists somewhere between Astra and Personna.  


## Goals of Wet Shaving

+ Get a better shave
  * Specifically with closeness 
  * Less stuble for longer periods of the day
  * Reduce irritation
+ Save Money 
  * Cartridge razors cost about 10$ per month which is 120$ per year
  * DE Razors cost about 10$ for 100 razors which is 3 months, $40 per year, plus 45-60$ shaving cream.  
  * Approximately 20$+ saving each year and producing a better shave
+ Actually enjoy shaving
  * Specifically the lather feels very good, is natural, and using a brush is relaxing
  * Accomplish a shave that is exceptional, versus a shave that is passable with cartridge shaving.
