# Shaving Upgrades 

Last month or so I have been working on my shaving technique.  In my first post on this topic I talked about some of the gear I purchased and what my preferences have been so far.  I've recenlty switched over to using a shaving soap instead of a cream as well as a pre shave cream.  I also have been pre soaking my brush in a coffee mug while I shower and focusing on building quality lather.  Two days a week I have added a pre-scrub routine and every night I use witch hazel to handle ingrown hairs.  

I think I have settled on platinum chrome personna blades as my favorite and I'll probably be purchasing them in bulk soon.  

The lather I have been focusing on mostly concerns it self with level of water.  The idea is to get the lather into a very slippery consistency while at the same time providing quality protection.  Generally I have started with a thicker soap on the brush followed by adding water until it reaches desired consistency.
